From a small office in Amsterdam, he built a website called Bookings.nl. This little startup grew steadily in its first few years. The formula for success was pretty simple: working hard to get it right for our customers. By 2005, we were well on our way to becoming the market leader for European bookers. This growth did not go unnoticed by other large players in the travelsphere. The Priceline Group acquired Bookings.nl in 2006 to give us the Booking.com we know today. Despite evolving from a small startup to a global player, little has changed about our company culture. We move forward by taking lots of small steps and executing at incredible speeds. Our Dutch roots encourage us to never be satisfied and to keep proving ourselves every day.'
